Bubble Sort:
This is a sorting algorithm which invloves repetitive swapping of ADJACENT elements if they are in the wrong order.
Time complecity for worst and average cases: O(n^2)
Not efficient for large data structures.

Algorithm:

  1. Take an array/list as the input.
  2. Iterate over the elements of the array using a for loop till arr.length-1 and repeat for following steps ( iteration var: i)
      1. Iterate over the elements of the array using a for loop till arr.length-i-1 and repeat for following steps ( iteration var: j)
          1. Compare arr[j] and arr[j+1]
          2. If arr[j] > arr[j+1], swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
  3. Print/return the sorted array
