Insertion Sort:
This is a sorting algorithm which involves virtually splitting the array into sorted and unsorted parts.
The first value from the unsorted portion of the array is picked and "inserted" into the correct position in the sorted array.
While finding the correct position to insert, we move all the elements greater than the value to be inserted by 1 position.

Time Complexity:
Worst and Average: O(N^2)
Best: O(n)

Algorithm:

1. Take an array as the input
2. Iterate over the elements of the arryay using a for loop till arr.length using the var i and repeat the following steps:
    1. assign the element arr[i] to a var temp
    2. assign a var j to i-1
    3. Repeat the following steps till j>=0 and arr[j]>temp // the value to be inserted "temp" 
        1. assign arr[j+1] to arr[j] // moving the elements by 1 position
        2. decrement j
    4. Assign arr[j+1] to temp //to insert the temp var in the correct position
3. return/print the sorted array.
