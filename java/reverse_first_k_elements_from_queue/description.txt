Given a queue and int K reverse the first k elements from the queue.
Example:
  i/p: q = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
        k = 3;
  o/p: q = [30, 20, 10, 40, 50]

Algorithm:
  1. create a stack.
  2. iterate from 1 to K:
      1. remove the first element of queue
      2. push the removed element to stack;
  3. loop till the size of the stack is 0:
      1. pop the elements of the stack
      2. offer the elements to queue
  4. iterate from 1 to q.size()-K:
      1. remove the elements from the queue
      2. offer it to the queue
