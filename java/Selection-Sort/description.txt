Selection Sort:
This is a sorting algorithm which involves repetive selection of the smallest/largest value from the unsorted portion of a list and swapping it to the sorted portion of the list.

The worst and average time complexity  for this algorithm is O(n^2)

Doesnot work for very large data structures.

Algorithm:

  1. Take an array/list as the input.
  2. Initialise variable i to 0 // first index of the list
  3. Use a while loop to repeat the below steps as long as i<array.length
      1. Initialise a variable minValue to arr[i] //first element of the unsorted portion.
      2. Initialise a variable minIndex to i // first index of the unsorted portion.
      3. Initialise a variable j to i+1
      4. Use a while loop to repeat the below steps as long as j<array.length
          1. Check if arr[j]<minValue;
              1. If yes, assign minValue to arr[j]
              2. assign minIndex to j
          2. increment j
      5. Swap arr[i] and arr[minIndex]
      6. increment i
  4. Print/return the sorted array.
